# Reporting issues

Please remember that this gem is merely **a wrapper** for the [Slick jQuery plugin](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick). This means that all issues
related to Slick itself **should not be reported** here (there is a [separate issue tracker](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues) for that).
I am not an author of the Slick plugin and do not maintain it. Same for Turbolinks and jquery-turbolinks gem.

If you need an example on how to integrate and use this gem in a Rails app, take a look at [this sample app](https://github.com/bodrovis/jquery-slick-rails-demo)
created by me (it also covers usage with Turbolinks). If you are totally stuck and need further guidance, don't hesitate to contact me directly.

If you wish to report a **problem related to this gem**, please provide

* Syptoms of the problem
* Your Rails version
* Version of the gem you are using
* Error stack trace
* Any errors/warnings displayed in the browser's console
* The code you are using to integrate and initialize Slick

Thank you for understanding! Hopefully, this gem will make your life as a developer a bit easier :).
